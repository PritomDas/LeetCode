I have implemented two different solutions for reversing the internal contents in a string.

Overall there are various concepts that can be utilised for string reversal in python:
  [a] using splicing
  [b] using inbuilt function "reversed" along with "join"
  [c] using two pointer concept
  [d] using looping {specially the while loop}
  
 I have uploaded the first two concepts that I did using a normal IDE for my own understanding and a look down through them will be
 helful for me future reference. The real leetcode solution is named as solution.py
